What is DevOps?
DevOps is a set of practices that help a organization by reducing the delivery time while maintaining each aspect of an Application i.e Automation, Code Quality, Monitoring and Testing of the Application.


In traditional software development, there is no communication between the development and operations teams, which cause inefficiencies, irregular development cycles, and deployment issues. DevOps work as a bridge to this gap by advocating for collaboration, automation, continuous integration, continuous delivery/deployment (CI/CD).

Key features of DevOps:
Automation: Employing tools and scripts to automate repetitive tasks like building, testing, and deployment, reducing errors and accelerating the development process.

Collaboration: Encouraging closer collaboration and communication between development, operations, and other stakeholders involved in the software development lifecycle.

Continuous Integration (CI): Merging code changes into a shared repository frequently, verifying each integration through automated testing to detect issues early.

Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD): Automatically deploying code to production or making it available for deployment after passing automated tests in a continuous manner.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Managing and provisioning infrastructure using code and automation tools to ensure consistency and scalability.

Monitoring and Feedback: Implementing monitoring tools to track performance, detect issues, and gather feedback, enabling continuous improvement.

By embracing DevOps practices, organizations can achieve faster delivery of software updates, higher quality products, increased efficiency, and better alignment between development and operational goals.
